        <h3>Who are the researchers?</h3>
        <p>Dr Peggy Series, Professor in Computational Psychiatry</p>
        <p>Ruchira Sakalle, M.Sc. Cognitive Science Student</p>

        <h3> What is the purpose of the study? </h3>
        <p>
            Through this project we aim to implement an online tool to investigate causal inference processes. As an initial step, we plan to conduct a pilot experiment involving around 10 healthy participants. This stage aims to validate the task's effectiveness and gather feedback. Additionally, we will perform simple data analysis to compare their behaviour with existing research findings on this particular task.</p>
        <h3> Why have I been asked to take part? </h3>
        <p>
            You have been asked to participate as your participation is valuable in helping the researchers assess the validity of the experiment and contribute to building a better tool. </p>
        <h3> Do I have to take part? </h3>
        <p>
            No – participation in this study is entirely up to you. You can withdraw from the study at any time, without giving a reason. Your rights will not be affected. If you wish to withdraw, contact the PI. We will stop using your data in any publications or presentations submitted after you have withdrawn consent. However, we will keep copies of your original consent, and of your withdrawal request. </p>
        <h3> What will happen if I decide to take part </h3>
        <p>
            If you choose to participate, you will receive an online link to access the experiment. During each trial, you will be presented with visual stimuli for a brief duration accompanied by sounds. Your task will be to indicate the number of disks you perceive by pressing specific keys on your keyboard. The entire experiment is expected to take no more than 15 minutes. At the end of the experiment, you will be asked a few questions regarding the task and the interface used. </p>
        <h3> Are there any risks associated with taking part?</h3>

        <p>
            There are no risks associated with participation. </p>
        <h3>
            Are there any benefits associated with taking part? </h3>
